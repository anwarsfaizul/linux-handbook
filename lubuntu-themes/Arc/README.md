# Arc Theme
 A flat theme with transparent elements 
Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements. The theme was originally designed and developed by [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), however an active fork has been maintained by [jnsh](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) which is getting fixes. This fork aims to keep the theme updated with new toolkit and desktop environment versions, resolve pre-existing issues, and improve and polish the theme while preserving the original visual design.
