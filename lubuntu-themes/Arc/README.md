# Arc Theme
Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements. The theme was originally designed and developed by [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), however an active fork has been maintained by [jnsh](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) which is getting fixes. This fork aims to keep the theme updated with new toolkit and desktop environment versions, resolve pre-existing issues, and improve and polish the theme while preserving the original visual design.

##### Arc Icon theme
Unfinished [Arc Icon theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme) is available which may not work as expected in some cases. This theme mainly includes icons for folders and mimetypes. If this theme doesn't provide application icons, it needs another icon theme to inherit them. By default this theme will look for the [Moka icon theme](https://snwh.org/moka) to get the missing icons. If Moka is not installed it will use the Gnome icon theme as fallback.
